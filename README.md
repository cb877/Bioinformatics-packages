### Guide to using Jupyter Notebook Christina's DNA Analysis codes.

<font color='green'>**Using functions you need**</font> \
You will need to read cells 1-5 regardless of which functions you want to analyse your DNA with. After that select whichever cell you need. Cells 6 and 7 must be used chronologically. Cells 8 and 9 must be used chronologically. 

<font color='green'>**Keeping Outputs concise**</font> \
Some readable code has been muted (#) to make analysis more streamlined. Delete only the four letters in #CODE, but don't change any of the spacing. Spacing is essential for readability of python scripts.

<font color='green'>**Data Quality checkpoints**</font> \
A number of cells are numbered as .1 and are data quality checkpoints. These are to make sure your imports and code is being read correctly. You don't need to run them if your code is working, but it's always good to double check.

<font color='green'>**Troubleshooting**</font> \
There is a separate Jupyter Notebook called Troubleshooting if you are having issues importing your files.
